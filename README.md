# Vintage Story Double Ladders

This is a stupid simple mod to [Vintage Story](https://vintagestory.at/) that doubles the number of ladders you get when crafting ladders.

Why? Because I don't like using the exploit where you only put a ladder every other block, but I felt bad using twice as many ladders as I could have been using.

Why does it also change the rope ladders even though those are normally not used with the exploit? Because the fact that you get 6 regular ladders but only 3 rope ladders would bother me more than the slight cheatiness of getting twice as many rope ladders as normal does.
